# Prior art for ideas not yet run

Muse's search, 2026-10-18 (council topic muse-neuron-research-2026-10, message 39), for Elise's rule: search before
building. Each idea's closest work, and what our version would add. Marked **checked** where Claude read the abstract
at source (2026-10-18 23:44 CT); everything else is Muse's reading and should be checked before it is cited.

## Self-recognition neurons (own writing against other models')

- **Checked:** Ackerman and Panickssery 2024, arXiv:2410.02064. Llama3-8b-Instruct (not base) separates its own text
  from human text; one residual-stream direction carries it and steers claimed authorship.
- Panickssery, Bowman and Feng 2024, arXiv:2404.13076: frontier models recognise and prefer their own outputs above
  chance; recognition drives preference. No localization.
- Ours would add: single neurons, and the contrast against other models' text rather than human text.

## A sweep for sparse, spiky neurons

- Li et al. 2022, "The Lazy Neuron Phenomenon", arXiv:2210.06313: MLP activations are very sparse and sparser with
  scale; an efficiency paper, no ranking of neurons.
- Gurnee et al. 2024, arXiv:2401.12181: universal neurons have extreme activation statistics (kurtosis detail not
  checked in the text).
- Bills et al. 2023, "Language models can explain neurons": every GPT-2 XL neuron explained by GPT-4 (arXiv id not
  checked).
- Ours would add: ranking every neuron by heavy-tailedness over a corpus as the discovery step, topic not chosen first.

## "Something's wrong" neurons

- Li et al. 2025, "Truth Neurons", arXiv:2505.12182: neurons for truth value of a proposition; suppressing them hurts
  TruthfulQA.
- Gao et al. 2025, "H-Neurons", arXiv:2512.01797: under 0.1% of FFN neurons predict hallucination; amplifying them
  raises false-premise acceptance (numbers from the listing only).
- Ours would add: units that fire on an error in the input text. The design has to separate that from truth value.

## Date and year neurons

- **Checked:** van Adrichem et al. 2026, arXiv:2608.15507 (COLM 2026). Prompting shifts the declarative year in 94.6%
  of cases and the associative year in 1.7%; year-shifted SFT matched the associative year in one of eight models;
  weight editing works per task but not for both. The current year is not consistently encoded.
- Shin et al. 2025, TARDIS, arXiv:2503.18693: vector-level steering for temporal shift.
- Ours would add: a single year neuron, tested on whether steering it moves the associative year and not only the
  stated one. The van Adrichem result is the bar.
